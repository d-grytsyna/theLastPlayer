A player may place any card he wishes open in the center of the table. 
This card is the start of the discard. The turn then passes to the next player clockwise, 
who must place a card of the same value or suit, if he has no card to turn, takes one card from the stock and the turn passes to the next player clockwise.

Some cards require certain actions from the players.

**2** - The next player, must take a card from the stock cards and skip his turn.

**3** - If the player plays a three, he may place another of his own card on it.

**4** - Each next player clockwise must place a card of the same suit, but one value higher. For example, the next player must lay a 5 of the same suit, the next player must lay a 6 of the same suit, etc. If any player has no such card, he must draw as many cards as the value of the top discard card from the stockpile.

**5, 6, 7** - Allowed to place a four.

**8** - Allowed to place on any card and the player who placed an eight may declare a new suit.

**Jack** - The next player clockwise skips his turn.

**Ace** - The direction of play is reversed.

**The joker** can replace any card of the player's choice.

Thus the game goes on until there is one player left without cards. The remaining players with cards in their hands, calculate penalty points for them. The value of the cards in penalty points is as follows: King, Queen, Jack and 10 are worth 10 points; Ace, 15 points; 8, 25 points; Joker, 40 points. Any player who reaches or exceeds a certain number of points is eliminated from the game. The last player to remain is the winner.
